# Note to maintainers

If using lein-clr to work on this, specifically, to run tests, be aware that the structure of the tests in this project does not conform to the leiningen standard.  
There is a file common_tests.clj that is loaded by several other test files  
(Speaking to the notion that an include-file should be added for when load is not appropriate, as here).  
The leiningen test framework will load common_tests.clj and fail.  
You need to run each top-level file directly.  For example,

```
lein.bat clr test clojure.tools.metadata-test clojure.tools.reader-test clojure.tools.reader-edn-test
```
